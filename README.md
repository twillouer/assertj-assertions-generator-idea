# Welcome to the AssertJ assertions generator for IntelliJ IDEA project !

## Overview 

The Assertion Generator is able to create assertions specific to your own classes, it comes with :
* a [**CLI tool**](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator)
* a [**maven plugin**](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator-maven-plugin) 
* an [**eclipse plugin**](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-eclipse-plugin) (planned for April).
* an [**idea plugin**]() who is a fork of the JUnit Generator v2 plugin 

Let's say that you have a `Player` class with `name` and `team` properties, the generator is able to create a `PlayerAssert` assertions class with `hasName` and `hasTeam` assertions, to write code like :

```java
assertThat(mvp).hasName("Lebron James").hasTeam("Miami Heat");
```

## Latest news

**2013-03-26 : 1.0.0 release : the first release after Fest fork, generated assertions are cleaner.**

## Generate assertions from Maven

You should use the provided [**maven plugin**](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator-maven-plugin).

## Use with Eclipse

We have developed an Eclipse plugin that allows you to generate assertions for a specific class (one at time only).  
Please check **[AssertJ eclipse plugin documentation](http://joel-costigliola.github.com/assertj-eclipse-plugin/)**.

## Quickstart for NON Maven users

### 1 - Get AssertJ assertions generator 

Get the AssertJ Assertions Generator 1.0.0 archive for **unix** or **windows** and extract it.

The archive structure is :

```
assertion-generator/
  |-- lib/
  |-- templates/
  |-- generate-assertions script (.bat or .sh)
```

### 2 - Generates assertions

- Put in `lib/` directory the jars containing the classes you want to generate assertions for .  

- Launch the scripts with either the **classes** or the **packages** containing the classes you want to generate assertions for.

Generate assertions for `TolkienCharacter` class :
```
generate-assertions.sh org.assertj.examples.data.TolkienCharacter 
```

Generate assertions for all classes in `org.assertj.examples.data` :
```
generate-assertions.sh org.assertj.examples.data 
```

- your assertions classes have been generated, go find them in the current directory

**Tip :**   
You can change what is generated by modifying the templates used for assertions creation (have a look at templates directory)
